    <h4>MATERIALS, CARE AND ORIGIN</h4>
    <h5>JOIN LIFE</h5>
    <p>
      Care for water: produced using less water.
      <br />
      We use the Join Life label on clothing that is produced using technology
      and raw materials that help us to reduce the environmental impact of our
      products.
      <br />
      CARE FOR WATER
      <br />
      These garments are produced with technologies that reduce water
      <span id="dots-c1">...</span>
      <span id="more-c1">
        consumption in their production processes.
        <br />
        The garment dyeing and washing processes consume the largest amount of
        water. Using closed circuits that allow us to reuse water or employing
        technologies such as low bath ratio machines or mass dyeing, which
        reduce water consumption, help us to preserve freshwater resources.

        Certifications
        <br />
        This product has been manufactured in accordance with the Join Life
        standard developed by the Inditex Group and based on Life-Cycle
        Assessment, an internationally standardised methodology used to evaluate
        the impact of a product in the different stages of its production, use
        and end of life.
        <br />
        In order to evaluate compliance with the standard, an auditing programme
        has been put in place to be carried out by specialised external
        companies.
